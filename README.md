 Project two of three from gamedev.tv's 
 "Complete Godot 2D: Develop Your Own 2D Games Using Godot 4"

 It added some more good foundational information to my GameDev
 arsenal. Things like:

 - Importing different kinds of assets
 - Full-screen stretch mode configuration
 - Different kinds of physics nodes and player movement
 - Path finding and spawning
 - Other available nodes...
